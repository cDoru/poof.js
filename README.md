**Professional Object Oriented Framework for web JavaScript and Node.js**

### About
POOF.js is not a new language. It does not require compilation.
It is a JavaScript framework providing advanced, powerful and highly efficient
features known from other object-oriented languages like Java or C#, such as
classes, interfaces, inheritance, accessibility specifiers, constants, static fields
and many more. POOF.js has been written to facilitade development of large projects
by enforcing a very clean, verbose and secure syntax on the developers.

### Release info
POOF.js is currently in Alpha state. It has gone through numerous iterations and all its functionality is implemented. It is not recommended to use it on projects with strict deadline yet until it goes Beta, but it is surely high time for all developers to start getting familiar with it.
